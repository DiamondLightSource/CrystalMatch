Setting up the Development Environment
======================================

This application is written in Python (v2.7) and was developed under Windows but should be portable to other platforms.

The following steps will help you prepare an appropriate Python environment to run this program. These instructions assume that you will use the 32-bit version on Python 2.7.11. The program should also run correctly under other versions of Python (e.g. 3.4, 3.5, 64bit), however due to an error in later versions of OpenCV (v3) on Windows, some features may not work correctly.

The guide below provides set-up instructions for both the Diamond Light Source python environment (dls-python) and Windows.

Recommended IDE
---------------
This application has been developed using the JetBrains PyCharm IDE. While the source code can be used separately using the information below, Pycharm is a highly recommended development tool.

A free community edition of Pycharm is available from <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>; the professional edition has additional features which are useful but not essential to this project.

The configuration files for Pycharm are located in `.idea` directories in the repository. The root level directory also contains example run configurations and should be detected automatically when opening the project with Pycharm for the first time.

DLS Linux Setup
---------------

This project is designed to be run at the Diamond Light Source using the Red Hat Linux and DLS-Python distributions available in-house.  The following steps are required when setting up a development environment for CrystalMatch in Pycharm.

* Download the repository from Github and open the directory in Pycharm (professional and community editions available through terminal).
* Create a new virtual environment from dls-python:
    * Open a terminal in the CrystalMatch directory and type the following commands
    
    ```
    > virtualenv -p /dls_sw/prod/tools/RHEL6-x86_64/Python/2-7-3/prefix/bin/dls-python venv --system-site-packages
    ```
    NOTE: this creates a virtual from dls-python which fulfills most dependencies except those required for unit tests.
    
    * Update the mock and nose-parameterized modules - required for the unittests.  In the same terminal type
    
    ```
    > source venv/bin/activate
    > pip install mock --upgrade
    > pip install parameterized
    ```
    
* Set interpreter - Open `File -> Settings -> Project -> Project Interpreter -> [cog icon] -> New Local...`. Add the virtual environment from the previous step as an existing virtual.
* In the settings also change `Tools -> Python Integrated Tools -> Default Test Runner` to be `UnitTest` - this is required for system and unit tests to run correctly.
* In the Project Explorer right-click on source directories (Source, dataset-builder, system-tests etc.) and mark them as source root directories.

Using the Source Code - Windows
-------------------------------

* Install the appropriate version of Python by downloading the Windows binary installer from <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/>
    * You want the one labelled 'Windows x86 MSI installer'
    * During installation, make sure you check ‘Add python.exe to system path’.
    
* The following packages are required:
    * numpy==1.11.1
    * OpenCV==2.4.10
    * scipy==0.19.1
    * pygelf==0.3.1
    * mock==1.0.1 (Testing only - standard in Python v3.3+ but required for unit tests to run under v2.7)
    * parameterized (Testing only)
    
* Most of these packages can be installed using `pip`. To do this:
    * Open cmd.exe (being sure to ‘Run as Administrator’)
    * Upgrade pip by typing `pip install –-upgrade pip`
    * Install enum by typing `pip install parametrized`
    
* The only package which cannot be installed using 'pip' is openCV. Download the right version of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases.html) and install it after doing all the pip installations.


Running from the Command Line
-----------------------------

To run the service from the command line from a CrystalMatch script without the focusing phase:

```
CrystalMatch[marked-image] [target-image] [x,y ...]
```

or with the focusing phase:

```
CrystalMatch[marked-image] [set-of-z-level-images] [x,y ...]
```


Unit Testing
------------

Unit tests have been in-lined with the module structure - unit tests for a class will be located in a file named `test_[file name]`.

In order to run unit tests in Pycharm right-click on a python module and select "Run unittests" - this will run all unit tests in the module and any sub-modules.

[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) has been configured to run all unittests after every push to the github repository to provide an effective integration.

The professional (paid licence) edition of Pycharm incorporates the `coverage` Python library which provides a rough indication of how much of the code is covered by unit tests.  The `coverage` tool can be run outside of Pycharm but has not been tested.

**NOTE:** System tests also use the python `unittest` framework, running all tests in the repository will take considerably longer than running only the unit tests.


System Tests
------------

At the time of writing system testing does not cover the application exhaustively - tests were added late in the development process and have been written to cover features as they are added or updated.

System tests are located in the `system-tests` directory of the repository. A custom System Testing Framework has been constructed which runs the algorithm and outputs the results to output directories named `sys_test_output` which are ignored by the git repository.  The framework should be self-documenting and will not be described here in detail.

The System Test Framework is based on the standard python `unittest` library (note that this will need to be installed during setup for Python 2.7). System Tests can be run in the same manner as unit tests but may require the `PYTHONPATH` variable to be added if you are not using Pycharm.

Travis does not run system tests due to lack of pip support for the used openCV version. This can be changed when the code is upgraded to use openCV v3.

The base `SystemTest` class extends `unittest.TestCase` - each `test_` method in a unit test class should cause the application to run once using the method `run_crystal_matching_test(test_name, cmd_line_args)`.  This will generate an output directory which contains the stdout and stderr in file form as well as the config directory and any file system output from the application itself.  The parent class `SystemTest` provides a series of helper methods which are primarily aimed at rapid testing of content in the output directory (including stdout).
