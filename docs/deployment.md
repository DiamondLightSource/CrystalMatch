## CrystalMatch - Deployment

This application is intended for deployment on a beamline control machine.

It is now deployed as part of the local Python environment - dls-python.

It is installed as all other internal python packages in:

/dls_sw/prod/common/python/RHEL6-x86_64/CrystalMatch

In order to install a new version internally follow the steps in Release Procedure.

The module can also be released externally on pypi (see relevant steps in Release Procedure).
The external release procedure is not required and does not affect the internal release in any way.

## Release Procedure

1. Bump the version number
2. Update release notes and dev notes
3. Push the changes to gitolite and github origins
4. Make sure that all unit tests pass on Travis and run system test locally and check that they pass
5. External release on pypi:
    1. activate your virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate):
    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools docutils wheel
    python setup.py sdist
    python setup.py bdist_wheel #this one worked for wheel==0.30.0 but not recent release
    ```
    2. exit your virtual environment (decativate) and do:
    ```
    module load python/ana
    python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
    python -m twine upload dist/*
    ```
    3. To test the released script do:
    ```
    virtualenv -p /dls_sw/prod/tools/RHEL6-x86_64/Python/2-7-3/prefix/bin/dls-python venv_cmd --system-site-packages
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    pip install CrystalMatch

    ```
6. Create a new release on github and add the whl and tar.gz files - the release will be tagged
7. Do internal release for dls-python:
    1. Add a tag with - instead of . in the version and push ot to gitolite_origin, for example:
    ```
    git tag 1-0-0
    git push gitolite_origin 1-0-0
    ```
    2. Run release script, wait for the build to finish and configure the path:
    ```
    dls-release.py -p -t CrystalMatch 1-0-0 (consider releasing a test version of the module first dls-release with -T)
    dls-last-release.sh -w
    configure-tool edit -p CrystalMatch 1-0-0
    ```
    3. Test the released script:
    ```
    CrystalMatch image.jpg focusing_dict 1800,1690 --scale 1.0:1.575
    ```

## Old Deployment

The deployment was before done by putting a script build using pyinstaller on a server.
The old location of 'CrystalMatch' was /dls_sw/dasc/CrystalMatch.
Although the location is not used to keep the code anymore it contains config files used by GDA.
